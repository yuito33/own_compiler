# Compiler Project – Initial Definition

## 1. Student Information
- **Name:** Yuito Sugimoto
- **Program:** 406C
- **Course:** Compiler Design
- **Semester / Year:** Spring / 2026

## 2. Project Overview
Provide a brief description of your compiler project (1–2 paragraphs). 
- In this project, I will design and implement a simple compiler that translates a subset of the Java programming to Java bytecode.

What problem does it solve? What kind of language are you designing or compiling?
- The compiler is to help understand the structure of modern compilers including lexical analysis, parsing semantic checks, and code generation.

Include the Programming language you will use to implement the compiler (e.g., C, C++, Java, Python, Rust, etc.)
- The compiler will be implemented in Python.

## 3. Source Language
- **Name of the source code language:** Java

## 4. Target / Output Language
- **Output of the compiler:**  Java bytecode
  (e.g., LLVM IR, Assembly, C code, Java bytecode, custom VM code, etc.)
- **Reason for choosing this output language:** This is because I often use Java in the CS class. And the  Java code is compiled to Java bytecode. I am curious what the compiler does.

## 5. Compiler Features (Planned)
List the features you plan to implement.
- Lexical analysis -- Tokenization of Java source code.
- Syntax analysis (parser type, if known) 
- Semantic analysis -- including type checking and so on.
- Intermediate representation
- Optimizations (if any)
- Code generation -- Generation of Java bytecode.

## 6. Tools and Libraries
List any tools, frameworks, or libraries you plan to use:
- Parser generators (e.g., ANTLR, Bison, Yacc)
 ANTLR
- Build tools
 Python standard library
- Testing frameworks
 Python unittest framework for testing
