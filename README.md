# Java-to-Java Bytecode Compiler

## Overview
In this project, I will design and implement a simple compiler that translates a subset of the Java programming to Java bytecode using Python.


---

## Features
- Lexical analysis -- Tokenization of Java source code.
- Syntax analysis (parser type, if known) 
- Semantic analysis -- including type checking and so on.
- Intermediate representation
- Optimizations (if any)
- Code generation -- Generation of Java bytecode.

---

## Architecture
The compiler consists of the following components:
1. Lexer
2. Parser
3. Semantic Analyzer
4. Code Generator

---

## Tools & Requirements
- Python
- Python standard libraries
- unittest (for testing)

---

## How to Run
1. Write Java source code using the supporte language subset.
2. Run the compiler
